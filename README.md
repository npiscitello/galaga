# Sample Rate
If we run the system on the 8MHz internal clock and use 8-bit resolution PWM for the audio, we'll
have a sample rate of 8000000/256=31250 Hz. I used Audacity to prepare the audio files - project
rate of 31250, split into mono and delete one channel, then export the audio to unsigned 8 bit raw.
